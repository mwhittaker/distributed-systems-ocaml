{2 Distributed Systems}

{9 Async}
Concurrency and parallelism are at the heart of distributed systems. When
programs scale to multiple threads, processes, or machines, we have to reason
about multiple computations that are all happening at the same time. In this
chapter, we explore Jane Street's monadic cooperative multithreading library:
Async. Async is a library that makes writing concurrent code fun and easy!
Async will also serve as a building block throughout the rest of the book; all
the code we write will involve async.
